# ButterworthWindow
A counter-intuitive approach. Using a butterworth filter to develop a butterworth window.

Implemented and evaluated a novel windowing method (in comparison to conventional windowing methods such as Hanning, Hamming, and
Kaiser). This window was designed based on the Butterworth filter for power spectral density estimation of digital signals.
